## Catalogue Course Description
Individual work culminating in a professional practice-oriented report.

## Introduction
The objective of EGN 6457 Research Methods (prerequisite) and EGN 6941 Project is to propose and execute a research project while improving communication skills in writing and presentation. In EGN 6457, students developed a research proposal, and in EGN 6941, they will execute the project and share their findings as described in the [course details](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/big-picture). This course provides the credit hours for students to conduct and complete their projects, monitored by the instructor through regular progress meetings. Students will work independently with technical support from faculty and external experts as needed.

## Course Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Define and develop an individual project for the MSE Program
2. Research project subject, and conduct and complete your project
3. Provide updates on report progress
4. Present class your project to class, or at a research symposium such as Eagle X
5. Submit professional project report

## Required Text 
No textbook required. Materials will be posted on Canvas.

## Assessment and Grading

### Grading Scale

| Grade | Percentage   | Grade | Percentage   |
|-------|--------------|-------|--------------|
| A     | 94–100%      | B-    | 80–83.99%    |  
| A-    | 90–93.99%    | C+    | 77–79.99%    |
| B+    | 87–89.99%    | C     | 74–76.99%    |
| B     | 84–86.99%    | D     | 64–66.99%    |
| F     | Below 60%    |       |              |

### Assessment Plan
- Project Proposal: 5%  
- Progress Meetings: 10%  
- Project Presentation: 20%  
- Project Report: 65%  

### Project Proposal
You need to submit a draft proposal by **Week 1** using [these guidelines](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/proposal-hw), and incorporate feedback for final approval by **Week 2**. The project proposal will be graded as "meets expectations" (full credit) or "does not meet expectations" (no credit), with potential deductions for unaddressed review comments from instructor.

### Progress Meetings
Bi-weekly, one-on-one meetings will be scheduled during Week 1 for the whole semester. These progress meetings are mandatory and graded. Each two instances of excessive tardiness (> 5 minutes) will count as one absence. Progress meetings may include some graded assignments (e.g., reading assignments) based on student needs. Additional meetings may be requested for guidance. 

### Project Presentation
Final presentations will take place on **April 22 (6:00–8:00 pm)** or as scheduled during class, and location will be announced once scheduled. Alternatively, you can present your work at Eagle X ([details](https://www.fgcu.edu/eaglex)) for extra credit. Winning an Eagle X Research Award guarantees an “A” grade, provided that the project report is submitted. Your presentatin should be well-organized, professional, with visual aids. Your presentation should follow the guidelines and rubric discussed in progress meetings. 

### Project Report
Students must complete and report on their independently chosen projects. Required submissions include a project proposal, progress report, and final report. Progress reports are ungraded but will receive instructor feedback to improve the final report. The project report is due by April 24 at 11:59 pm. Your reports must be professional, polished, and free of errors. You must adhere to citation and plagiarism policies including including proper references. You need to follow the guidelines and rubric discussed in progress meetings.

### Late Assignment Policy
- If you encounter challenges that may affect your ability to submit on time, please communicate with the instructor as early as possible to explore possible accommodations.
- Deadline maybe extended for [execused absences](#Execused-Absence-Policy)
- Unexecused late submissions received after the deadline will incur a penalty of 10% per day up to a maximum of 50% deduction
- Once grades are posted, late unexecused submissions will not be accepted, and a score of zero will be assigned

### Execused Absence Policy
- Absence excuse requires written documentation from a certified medical professional, faculty member, administration, coach, or athletic director.
- Absence will be execused after the verification of the submitted document
- Any attempt to falsify documents will be taken very seriously in accordance with [FGCU policies and procedures](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf)

### Additional Notes
- Incomplete Grades: Only in exceptional circumstances
- Drop Deadlines: Refer to the academic calendar
- Grades Due: Tuesday, May 6, 2025

## Program Learning Outcomes  
The learning outcomes for the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) Program are as follows.

### Content/Discipline Knowledge and Skills (DK) – MSE graduates will be able to:  
1. Apply higher-level math, science, and engineering skills to research and/or design engineering systems, components, or processes to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability.  
2. Understand the professional and ethical responsibilities associated with engineering practice and engineering research.  
3. Use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice and engineering research.  

Content/discipline knowledge and skills are assessed at the program level using appropriate coursework including examinations, assignments, and presentations.

### Communication Skills (CS) – MSE graduates will be able to:  
1. Organize and relate ideas coherently in written, oral, and graphic form.  
2. Develop and present consistent arguments to diverse audiences.

Communication skills are assessed at the University, College, and Program levels through oral and written presentations, project reports, and other assignments throughout the curriculum.

### Critical Thinking Skills (CT) – MSE graduates will be able to:  
1. Identify problems and the relevant information needed to solve them.  
2. Analyze and synthesize information and draw reasoned inferences.  
3. Formulate and evaluate appropriate problem-solving strategies.

Critical thinking skills are assessed at the University, College, and Program levels through oral and written presentations, project reports, exams, and other assignments throughout the curriculum.

## University Policies

## Core Syllabus Policies 
FGCU has a set of central policies related to student recording class sessions, academic integrity and grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, generative AI, and religious observances that apply to all courses at FGCU. Be sure to review these [online](https://www.fgcu.edu/about/leadership/officeoftheprovost/core-syllabus-policy-statements)

### Generative AI Use
Permitted with proper citation. Students must document AI usage in the appendix. Non-compliance will be treated as academic dishonesty.  

### Policy for Academic Integrity Violations 
- Academic dishonesty in assignments, projects, or exams will result in a grade of zero for that submission, and will be strictly addressed in line with [FGCU policies and procedures](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf).
- Familiarize yourself with the [FGCU Student Guidebook](https://www.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/) that outlines the consequences for academic integrity violations.
