### Assessment Plan
- Participation: 5%  
- Project Proposal: 5%
- Project Presentation: 10%
- Project Report: 80%  

### Participation
In the [kickoff meeting](https://aselshall.github.io/pr/hw/meeting0) in week 1, which must be attended by all students, we will plan for the rest of the semester. One-on-one progress meetings will be scheduled for the entire semester during the kickoff meeting. The progress meetings, which are online or in-person, are mandatory and graded. Additional non-graded meetings for guidance can be requested by either the student or the instructor as needed.

Your participation grade will reflect your professional attitude. You are expected to attend on time, be prepared, and effectively address feedback. Additionally, effective time management is part of the participation evaluation. For example, students who request additional final report reviews, need to do this at least one week before the final submission deadline to allow for meaningful feedback. Last-day requests should be limited to specific and legitimate questions, not for reviewing entire reports or resolving issues stemming from ignored feedback throughout the semester. Also, teamwork is a key skill and the student is expected to engage with the instructor and technical advisor (if presentas) as collaborative team members. Your participation grade will assess your professional attitude and professional maturity during the course according to the following expectations.

| **Criteria**              | **Good (9-10 Points)**                                         | **Satisfactory (5-8 Points)**                             | **Needs Improvement (0-4 Points)**                           |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Punctuality (5%)**       | Attends  meeting on time, ready to begin                    | Late but provides valid reasons               |  Late with repeated invalid excuses                 |
| **Preparedness (35%)**     | Prepared with clear updates, progress, and specific questions | Somehow unprepared or provides vague updates              | Unprepared, with no meaningful updates or questions       |
| **Responsiveness to feedback (35%)** | Applies instructor feedback constructively and shows steady improvement | Applies feedback inconsistently or delays acting on it      | Frequently ignores feedback or repeats previous mistakes       |
| **Time management (15%)**  | Manages deadlines effectively and requests feedback well in advance | Relies on last-minute feedback requests |  Misses deadlines or depends on last-minute help     |
| **Teamwork and communication (10%)** | Engages respectfully and professionally with the instructor and advisor as collaborative team members, and responds promptly to emails/requests| Communication is polite but lacks consistent collaboration | Dismissive, uncooperative, or unprofessional behavior          |

#### Notes on the rubric
- Preparedness and responsiveness to feedback (70%) are critical for progress and improvement
- If punctuality becomes a recurring issue, it will be combined with time management

#### Absence and Rescheduling
- One unexecused absence will not affect your participation grade provided that you informed the instructor in advance
- Rescheduling with credit is only permitted for an execused absence
- Unexecused absence or rescheduleing without an execused absence results in zero for this meeting
- Execused absence requires written documentation as outlined in the [Execused Absence Policy](https://aselshall.github.io/pr/#execused-absence-policy)

### Project Proposal
You need to submit a draft proposal by week 1 following  [the kickoff meeting guidelines](https://aselshall.github.io/pr/hw/meeting0), and incorporate feedback for final approval by your [first progress meeting](https://aselshall.github.io/pr/hw/meeting1). Your proposal needs to adhere to [these guidelines](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/proposal-hw). The project proposal will be graded as "meets expectations" (full credit) or "does not meet expectations" (no credit), with potential deductions for unaddressed review comments from instructor.

### Project Presentation
In-person final presentations are scheduled for **April 22 (6:00–7:30 pm)**. While these date and time are fixed, they may be subject to change due to unforeseen circumstances. The presentation location will be announced during the semester. Alternatively, you may present your work at [Eagle X](https://www.fgcu.edu/eaglex) for extra credit. Winning an Eagle X Research Award guarantees an “A” grade, provided that the project report is submitted. Your presentation must be well-organized, professional, and include visual aids. Your presentation must adhere to the [final presentation guidelines and rubric](https://aselshall.github.io/pr/hw/presentation).

### Project Report  
Students are required to complete their projects and document their independent work in a professional and polished report. The report must follow and adhere to this [rubric](https://aselshall.github.io/pr/hw/rubric).  

## Course Policies

### Academic Integrity
Any instance of data falsification or fabrication will result in a grade of zero for your report and further actions as per [FGCU policies and procedures](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf). Data falsification involves manipulating real data to misrepresent results. Data fabrication involves inventing data that does not exist. Also, your proposal, report and presentation must adhere to citation and plagiarism policies, including proper referencing practices

### Late Assignment Policy
- If you encounter challenges that may affect your ability to submit on time, please communicate with the instructor as early as possible to explore possible accommodations.
- Deadline maybe extended for [execused absences](#Execused-Absence-Policy)
- Unexecused late submissions received after the deadline will incur a penalty of 20% per day.
- Once grades are posted, late unexecused submissions will not be accepted, and a score of zero will be assigned.

### Execused Absence Policy
- A valid excuse requires written documentation from a certified medical professional, work supervisor, faculty member, administrator, coach, or athletic director.
- Examples of invalid excuses include:
  - "I'm traveling for work" (without supporting documentation)
  - "I am not feeling well today"
  - "There was an accident on I-75"
  - "I have a flat tire" (with a photo showing a flat tire)
- Examples of valid excuses include:
  - "I'm traveling for work," with an attached letter from your supervisor
  - "I have a medical appointment," with an attached note from a medical professional
  - "I'm attending a university-sanctioned event," with documentation from the event organizer, faculty, or coach
- Absences or missing a deadline will only be excused after the verification of the submitted documentation.
- Any attempt to falsify documents will be taken very seriously in accordance with [FGCU policies and procedures](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf)

### Additional Notes
