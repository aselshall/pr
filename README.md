## Catalogue Course Description
Individual work culminating in a professional practice-oriented report.

## Introduction
This course provides credit hours for executing the research project developed in EGN 6457 Research Methods (prerequisite), as outlined in the ["Big Picture"](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/big-picture). Students will independently conduct, complete, and present their projects, with guidance from the instructor through regular progress meetings and technical support from faculty and external experts as needed.

## Course Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Define and develop an individual project for the MSE Program
2. Research project subject, and conduct and complete your project
3. Provide updates on report progress
4. Present your project to class, or at a research symposium such as Eagle X
5. Submit professional project report

## Required Text 
No textbook required. Materials will be posted on Canvas.

## Assessment and Grading

### Grading Scale

| Grade | Percentage   | Grade | Percentage   |
|-------|--------------|-------|--------------|
| A     | 94–100%      | B-    | 80–83.99%    |  
| A-    | 90–93.99%    | C+    | 77–79.99%    |
| B+    | 87–89.99%    | C     | 74–76.99%    |
| B     | 84–86.99%    | D     | 64–66.99%    |
| F     | Below 60%    |       |              |

### Assessment Plan
- Project Proposal: 5%
- Participation: 10%  
- Project Presentation: 10%  
- Project Report: 75%  

### Project Proposal
You need to submit a draft proposal by **Week 1** using [these guidelines](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/proposal-hw), and incorporate feedback for final approval by **Week 2**. The project proposal will be graded as "meets expectations" (full credit) or "does not meet expectations" (no credit), with potential deductions for unaddressed review comments from instructor.

### Participation
Bi-weekly, one-on-one progress meetings will be scheduled during Week 1 for the entire semester. These meetings are mandatory and graded. Every two instances of excessive tardiness (> 5 minutes) will count as one absence. Meetings may also include graded assignments (e.g., reading assignments) based on individual student needs. Additional non-graded meetings for guidance can be requested by either the student or the instructor as needed.

Your participation grade will reflect your professional attitude. For example, students must request report reviews at least one week before the final submission deadline to allow for meaningful feedback. Last-day requests should be limited to specific and legitimate questions, not for reviewing entire reports or resolving issues stemming from ignored feedback during the semester. Effective time management is a basic skill and will be considered as part of the evaluation for participation. Teamwork is another key skill and the student is expected to engage with the instructor and technical advisor (if presentas) as collaborative team members. Your participation grade will assess your professional attitude and maturity during the course according to the following expectations.

| **Criteria**              | **Exemplary (10 Points)**                                         | **Satisfactory (6-9 Points)**                             | **Needs improvement (0- 5 Points)**                           |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attendance and punctuality (25%)** | Attends all scheduled meetings on time and actively participates. | Occasionally late or misses meetings without valid reasons. | Frequently late or absent, disrupting progress.                |
| **Preparedness (25%)**          | Consistently comes prepared with clear updates, progress, and specific questions. | Sometimes unprepared or provides vague updates.              | Rarely prepared, with no meaningful updates or questions.       |
| **Time management (20%)**       | Manages deadlines effectively and requests feedback well in advance. | Occasionally late or relies on last-minute feedback requests. | Frequently misses deadlines or depends on last-minute help.     |
| **Responsiveness to feedback (20%)** | Applies instructor feedback constructively and shows steady improvement. | Applies feedback inconsistently or delays acting on it.      | Frequently ignores feedback or repeats previous mistakes.       |
| **Teamwork and communication (10%)** | Engages respectfully and professionally with the instructor and advisor as collaborative team members. | Communication is polite but lacks consistent collaboration.  | Dismissive, uncooperative behavior, or unprofessional      |


### Project Presentation
Final presentations will take place on **April 22 (6:00–7:30 pm)** or as scheduled during class, and location will be announced once scheduled. Alternatively, you can present your work at Eagle X ([details](https://www.fgcu.edu/eaglex)) for extra credit. Winning an Eagle X Research Award guarantees an “A” grade, provided that the project report is submitted. Your presentatin should be well-organized, professional, with visual aids. Your presentation should follow the guidelines and rubric discussed in progress meetings. 

### Project Report
Students must complete and report on their independently chosen projects. Required submissions include a progress report, and final report. The progress report is ungraded but will receive instructor feedback to improve the final report. The project report is due by April 24 at 11:59 pm. 

Your reports must be professional, polished, and free of errors. You must adhere to citation and plagiarism policies including including proper references. You need to follow the guidelines and rubric discussed in progress meetings.

### Late Assignment Policy
- If you encounter challenges that may affect your ability to submit on time, please communicate with the instructor as early as possible to explore possible accommodations.
- Deadline maybe extended for [execused absences](#Execused-Absence-Policy)
- Unexecused late submissions received after the deadline will incur a penalty of 10% per day up to a maximum of 50% deduction
- Once grades are posted, late unexecused submissions will not be accepted, and a score of zero will be assigned

### Execused Absence Policy
- Absence excuse requires written documentation from a certified medical professional, faculty member, administration, coach, or athletic director.
- Absence will be execused after the verification of the submitted document
- Any attempt to falsify documents will be taken very seriously in accordance with [FGCU policies and procedures](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf)

### Additional Notes
- Incomplete Grades: Only in exceptional circumstances
- Drop Deadlines: Refer to the academic calendar
- Grades Due: Tuesday, May 6, 2025

## University Policies

## Core Syllabus Policies 
FGCU has a set of central policies related to student recording class sessions, academic integrity and grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, generative AI, and religious observances that apply to all courses at FGCU. Be sure to review these [online](https://www.fgcu.edu/about/leadership/officeoftheprovost/core-syllabus-policy-statements)

### Generative AI Use
Permitted with proper citation. Students must document AI usage in the appendix. Non-compliance will be treated as academic dishonesty.
