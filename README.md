### Project Proposal
Submit a draft proposal by **Week 1** using [these guidelines](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/proposal-hw). Incorporate feedback for final approval by **Week 2**. The project proposal will be graded as "meets expectations" (full credit) or "does not meet expectations" (no credit), with potential deductions for unaddressed review comments from instructor.

Alternatively, you can present your work at Eagle X ([details](https://www.fgcu.edu/eaglex)) for extra credit.
