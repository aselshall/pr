### Instructions  

To ensure a productive discussion, before your third progress meeting, you are required to complete the following:  

1. Submit a draft of your interim report:  
   - Prepare a draft of your interim report that reflects updates to your deliverables, timeline, and progress since the second meeting     
   - Ensure the draft includes all sections outlined in the rubric, with placeholders for incomplete parts   
   - Upload your draft interim report to your folder on Teams before the meeting   

2. Prepare an update on progress:  
   - Summarize the work you have completed since the second meeting in slides 
   - Identify tasks that were delayed or modified and provide an explanation  

3. Identify challenges:  
   - Be ready to discuss any difficulties you have faced, such as technical issues, time management, or data analysis challenges  

4. Update your timeline:  
   - Revise your project timeline to reflect progress and account for remaining tasks
   - Highlight key tasks and milestones leading up to the submission of the interim report and subsequent project phases

### Grading  
- Progress meetings will be graded according to the rubric in the [syllabus](https://aselshall.github.io/pr/#participation).
- Ensure that you demonstrate progress, address challenges effectively, and actively engage in planning the next steps.  
- To receive credit, after each meeting, use the rubric to grade yourself and upload your grade on Canvas within 24 hours. 
- The instructorâ€™s evaluation will serve as the final grade, but your self-assessment will be reviewed to provide feedback and address any discrepancies.

### Next step  

This meeting ensures you are on track to submit a high-quality interim report by the deadline and prepares you for the final stages of the project. We will discuss tasks for our [last progress meeting](https://aselshall.github.io/pr/hw/meeting4)
