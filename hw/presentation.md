#### Guidelines
- I will collect your peer-evaluations at the end of the class. This will count as your participation grade for this class, so do not forget to add your name on them. Non-serious submissions, such as giving all full marks without providing critical feedback, will be discarded, and those grades will not count. Thoughtful and constructive evaluations are expected.
- Upload your final presentation on Canvas at least 30 minutes before class. Failure to do so disrupts class organization and will result in a 50% deduction from you participation grade for this class. In professional settings, such as conferences, failing to meet upload deadlines can result in the cancellation of your presentation.

#### Evaluation
- For detailed criteria, review the [presentation rubric](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/presentation-rubric) , which you can also download from this [Link](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/Presentation%20rubric.docx).
